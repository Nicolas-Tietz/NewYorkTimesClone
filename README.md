## About the Project

The project is a clone of the New York Times homepage created to learn more about React.

The homepage contains news fetched using their public API's. 

On top of the page, there is also a Weather Box, created using https://www.weatherapi.com/

There are 3 sections of news:

- Main News are fetched from their homepage API and grouped based on their shared topics.

- Secondary News are instead fetched from specific topics, like science and sports.

- Side News are fetched like secondary news, but located into the sidebar. These include opinion and real-estate news.
